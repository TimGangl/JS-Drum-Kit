# JS-Drum-Kit
This was built while working on the #Javascript#30 program, where I was challenged to create 30 things in 30 days. 

## Getting Started
All you need to do is clone down the repo running the following code:
```
 git clone https://github.com/TimGangl/JS-Drum-Kit.git
```
Then navigate to root folder and click on file named index and enjoy.
